Pratice project:

Trying to reproduce an example of a small project I saw from Coding Adventure with Sebastian Lague.

First project in unity that isn't following a Unity Tutorial.

The purpose of the project is the have a scene with a player object.
If the player object is within an area, enimies will move in on the player
to push the player around, and/or collide with player to destroy them

stretch goal is to create the tower that shoots at player
